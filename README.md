# Anki Font Resizer

This Anki-add-on allows to adjust the text size on the front and back of each card. Three buttons, *A+*, *A-* and *A (delete)*, are added to the interface. When text is selected, its size can be increased or decreased by 10%, with a minimum of 50% and a maximum of 400%.

## Developstate

The following issues are currently known:

- When resizing a selected text that occurs multiple times, only the first occurrence is affected
- After each action the selected text is no longer selected
