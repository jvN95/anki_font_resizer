# Anki Font Resizer

This Anki-add-on allows to adjust the text size on the front and back of each card. Two buttons, *A+* and *A-*, are added to the interface. When text is selected, its size can be increased or decreased by 10%, with a minimum of 50% and a maximum of 400%.

## Developstate

The following issues are currently known:

    - Resizing multiple lines does not work
    - When resizing a selected text that occurs multiple times, only the first occurrence is affected
